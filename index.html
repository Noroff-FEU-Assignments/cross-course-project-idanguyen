    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would first advise my potential client to be aware of what kind of threats may occur, and educate all the parties in web application development the most common threats like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site resource forgery (CSRF)
      This will help the team to know how to work and take responsibility in the security. 
      Then sensitize data and don’t trust any unknown input from the browser. 
      Invest in integrated automatic secure systems. 
      This will help the client to find and eliminate any issues much faster, and fewer error will occur than with manually work.
      The client must also use different security measures. You can’t relay on just one because vulnerability scanning must be combined with network scanning as well to fully secure the web servers.
      To secure date between client and server only using HTTPS. 
      Integrate any passord and access with two access authentication for the site.  </p>
